 # c64-devkit
All you need to start programming 6510 assembler for the Commodore 64 on Microsoft Windows.

## Usage
Run `build.bat` to compile, crunch and launch your code in the VICE emulator. This produces `build\c64-devkit.prg` which is runable on a real Commodore 64 or using an emulator.

## Notes
Source code is located in `source/` and can reside in multiple files ending with `.asm`. 

This devkit is based on the following components:
* ACME https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/
* pucrunch https://github.com/mist64/pucrunch
* VICE http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/
* genosine https://github.com/cliffordcarnmo/genosine
* Pixcen https://github.com/Hammarberg/pixcen
* GangEd http://www.thegang.nu/releases.php?type=4&year=all&headline=Utils&nomenu=1
* vchar64 https://github.com/ricardoquesada/vchar64
